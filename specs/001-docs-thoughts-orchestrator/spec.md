## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Implementation plan document provides comprehensive architecture details
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: orchestrator service, 50+ agents, stateful workflows, service integrations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: project creation ‚Üí workflow execution ‚Üí movie production
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement mapped to orchestrator capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities (workflow states, agents, projects)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focuses on user value, avoiding implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Content creators need an intelligent system that coordinates AI agents to produce complete movies automatically. Users start a movie project, and the orchestrator manages the entire production pipeline from initial concept through final video delivery, handling complex dependencies between specialized creative agents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a movie concept, **When** they submit a project request, **Then** the orchestrator creates a workflow and begins coordinating story development agents
2. **Given** story development is complete, **When** the orchestrator evaluates the results, **Then** it automatically transitions to character creation and scene planning phases
3. **Given** multiple movie projects are running, **When** the system encounters resource conflicts, **Then** it intelligently schedules agent work to maximize throughput
4. **Given** an agent fails during execution, **When** the orchestrator detects the failure, **Then** it automatically retries or routes to alternative agents without losing progress
5. **Given** a workflow reaches a decision point, **When** user input is required, **Then** the system pauses and presents clear options for user selection

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple agents need the same external service simultaneously?
- How does the system handle partial failures during long-running movie productions?
- What occurs when user projects exceed expected resource requirements?
- How does the orchestrator maintain consistency when external services become unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST coordinate execution of 50+ specialized AI agents for movie production
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain persistent workflow state across long-running production processes
- **FR-003**: System MUST support multiple concurrent movie projects without interference
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically route tasks to appropriate agents based on capabilities and availability
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time progress updates and status monitoring for active workflows
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle agent failures with automatic retry and error recovery mechanisms
- **FR-007**: System MUST support conditional workflow branching based on quality checks and user decisions
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate with external services for project management, knowledge storage, and media generation
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to pause, resume, and cancel active workflows
- **FR-010**: System MUST track workflow execution history and maintain audit logs
- **FR-011**: System MUST support human-in-the-loop decision points during workflow execution
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate workflow completion and ensure all required deliverables are produced
- **FR-013**: System MUST scale to handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: concurrent workflow capacity target not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST complete movie production within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable time limits not defined]
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: uptime/availability requirements not specified] service availability

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow**: Represents a complete movie production process with defined states, transitions, and associated agents
- **Agent**: Specialized AI service with specific capabilities (story, character, visual, production) and resource requirements
- **Project**: User-initiated movie concept with metadata, preferences, and associated workflows
- **Execution Context**: Runtime state including current step, completed tasks, pending operations, and intermediate results
- **Task**: Individual work unit assigned to agents with input data, execution parameters, and expected outputs
