# Research: LangGraph Agent Orchestrator Service

## LangGraph Workflow Framework
**Decision**: Use LangGraph as the primary workflow orchestration framework  
**Rationale**: 
- Built specifically for complex, stateful AI workflows with conditional branching
- Native support for state persistence and error recovery
- Human-in-the-loop decision points built-in
- Strong integration with AI/LLM workloads
- Active development and community support

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Apache Airflow: Too heavyweight, not designed for AI workflows
- Temporal: Good for workflows but lacks AI-specific features
- Custom state machine: High development overhead, reinventing the wheel

## State Management Strategy
**Decision**: Use Redis for workflow state persistence with structured data models  
**Rationale**:
- Fast in-memory access for real-time workflow updates
- Pub/Sub capabilities for real-time progress notifications
- Support for complex data structures (hashes, sets, streams)
- Battle-tested for high-throughput applications
- Built-in clustering for high availability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PostgreSQL: Slower for frequent state updates, overkill for ephemeral workflow data
- In-memory only: Loss of state on service restart, no persistence guarantees

## Agent Communication Patterns
**Decision**: Hub-and-spoke architecture with orchestrator as central coordinator  
**Rationale**:
- Enables monitoring and logging of all inter-agent communication
- Prevents direct agent-to-agent coupling
- Allows for centralized error handling and retry logic
- Supports dynamic agent discovery and routing
- Facilitates workflow state management and consistency

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct agent-to-agent: Complex dependency management, harder to monitor
- Event-driven architecture: Higher complexity, eventual consistency challenges

## External Service Integration
**Decision**: HTTP-based integration with circuit breaker pattern  
**Rationale**:
- Auto-Movie App: REST API for project CRUD operations
- Brain Service: WebSocket MCP protocol for real-time knowledge queries
- Task Service: HTTP with async polling for long-running GPU tasks
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Standardized error handling and retry mechanisms

**Alternatives Considered**:
- gRPC: Not supported by all external services
- Message queues: Adds infrastructure complexity, overkill for current needs

## Error Handling and Fault Tolerance
**Decision**: Multi-layered error handling with automatic retry and graceful degradation  
**Rationale**:
- Agent-level: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
- Workflow-level: Checkpoint-based recovery and alternative routing
- Service-level: Circuit breakers and health checks
- System-level: Resource monitoring and scaling controls

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Categorize errors (transient, permanent, recoverable)
- Implement retry policies with exponential backoff
- Use circuit breakers for external service calls
- Maintain workflow checkpoints for recovery
- Provide manual intervention capabilities for complex failures

## Performance and Scalability Architecture
**Decision**: Async Python with horizontal scaling support  
**Rationale**:
- asyncio for handling high concurrency without thread overhead
- FastAPI for high-performance HTTP endpoints
- Redis clustering for state management scalability
- Stateless orchestrator instances for horizontal scaling
- Load balancer for request distribution

**Performance Targets**:
- 100+ concurrent workflows
- 1000+ agent executions per minute
- Sub-second workflow status queries
- <2 hour complete movie production cycles

## Monitoring and Observability
**Decision**: Comprehensive monitoring with structured logging and metrics  
**Rationale**:
- Structured JSON logging for automated analysis
- Correlation IDs for cross-service tracing
- Workflow execution metrics and business KPIs
- Health checks and alerting for proactive maintenance
- Performance profiling for optimization opportunities

**Monitoring Stack**:
- Structured logging: Python logging with JSON formatter
- Metrics: Custom metrics for workflow and agent performance
- Tracing: Correlation IDs across all service interactions
- Health checks: Endpoint monitoring and dependency validation

## Security and Authentication
**Decision**: API key authentication with workflow integrity validation  
**Rationale**:
- Service-to-service authentication via API keys
- Workflow state integrity through checksums/signatures
- User isolation through project-based access control
- Secure handling of sensitive workflow data and credentials

**Security Measures**:
- TLS encryption for all external communications
- API key rotation policies
- Audit logging for security events
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure credential management for external services

## Development and Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Test-driven development with comprehensive testing layers  
**Rationale**:
- Contract tests for all service boundaries
- Integration tests for complete workflow scenarios
- Unit tests for individual components and logic
- Performance tests for scalability validation
- Chaos testing for fault tolerance verification

**Testing Approach**:
- Mock external services for isolated testing
- Test data generation for realistic scenarios
- Continuous integration with automated test execution
- Performance benchmarking and regression testing
